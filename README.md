<p>The travelling salesman problem (TSP) asks the following
	question: Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of
	cities, what is the shortest possible route that visits each city
	exactly once and returns to the origin city? It is an NP-hard problem
	in combinatorial optimization, important in operations research and
	theoretical computer science.
<p>
<p>TSP is a special case of the travelling purchaser problem.</p>
<p>In the theory of computational complexity, the decision version
	of the TSP (where, given a length L, the task is to decide whether the
	graph has any tour shorter than L) belongs to the class of NP-complete
	problems. Thus, it is possible that the worst-case running time for any
	algorithm for the TSP increases superpolynomially (or perhaps
	exponentially) with the number of cities.</p>
<p>The problem was first formulated in 1930 and is one of the most
	intensively studied problems in optimization. It is used as a benchmark
	for many optimization methods. Even though the problem is
	computationally difficult, a large number of heuristics and exact
	methods are known, so that some instances with tens of thousands of
	cities can be solved completely and even problems with millions of
	cities can be approximated within a small fraction of 1%.</p>
<p>The TSP has several applications even in its purest formulation,
	such as planning, logistics, and the manufacture of microchips.
	Slightly modified, it appears as a sub-problem in many areas, such as
	DNA sequencing. In these applications, the concept city represents, for
	example, customers, soldering points, or DNA fragments, and the concept
	distance represents travelling times or cost, or a similarity measure
	between DNA fragments. In many applications, additional constraints
	such as limited resources or time windows may be imposed.</p>
